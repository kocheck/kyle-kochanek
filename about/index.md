# About Kyle
I am Kyle Kochanek, a designer who loves building and learning new things. 

I have had the opportunity to create for Fortune 500 companies, multiple governments, universities, and, much to my brother's jealousy, the NFL.

The work I enjoy the most revolves around empowering the community around me. Thinking about accessibility, usability, and recyclability.
